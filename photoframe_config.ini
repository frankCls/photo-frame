# - remote_name: the name you chose during 'rclone config'
# - folder_path: the Dropbox folder to sync from
# Examples:
#   photoframe:PhotoFrame_Uploads (remote "photoframe", folder "PhotoFrame_Uploads")
#   mydropbox:Family/Photos (remote "mydropbox", nested folder)
#   photoframe: (remote "photoframe", root of Dropbox)
# Run 'rclone listremotes' to see your configured remotes
